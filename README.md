Analytics Process: CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Process For Data Mining) Methodology

### Business Understanding
What factors influence college admission and how do they affect it? 
To find the answer, we analyze the pattern behind the data and use three classification machine models to help predict the admission result. 
In the following sections, we'll uncover the mystery of how colleges measure whether an applicant is eligible for admission.

### Data Understanding
There are 8 variables
1. GRE Score
2. TOEFL Score
3. University Rating
4. SOP
5. LOR
6. CGPA --> GPA
7. Research
8. Chance of Admit

### Data Preparation
- The dataset is very clean with no empty value
- Transformation from continuous numeric variable into discrete numeric variable as a predicative target

### Modeling
1. Logistic Regression
2. K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Random Forest

### Evaluation
Metric: Cross valid accuracy
Random Forest model has the highest accuracy.
